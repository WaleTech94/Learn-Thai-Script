# Changelog

Every versioned app release must update this file and `AGENTS.md` in the same commit. The local `CLAUDE.md` mirror must also be synchronized when present.

- Audited all 96 lesson words by instructional purpose: 65 core, 23 recognition and 8 decode-only.
- Limited English→Thai spoken retrieval and Spell it to genuinely useful core vocabulary.
- Kept recognition vocabulary receptive: hear it, read it and identify its meaning without requiring production.
- Removed decode-only words from lesson meaning questions, listening checks and mixed vocabulary review while preserving them as script examples.
- Added visible RECOGNISE and DECODE ONLY labels on lesson word pages.
- Added an app-start vocabulary contract that rejects missing roles and decode-word leakage into vocabulary questions or distractors.
